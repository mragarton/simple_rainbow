# Simple Rainbow `(Discord Role color changing script)`
> A bot made to change Discord Role colors hereby making the member names stand out from the crowd.

> In order to use this bot, you will need to update the `cfg.json` file with your own Discord Bot Token, server (guild) and role names.

> We highly suggest not going under 3 seconds of delay between switching colors and staying between 50-150 array sizes for the rainbow colors. (See: `"rainbowArraySize": 50`)

> Now you can select your desired color outcome configured in the `cfg.json` file.
Edit `"type"`: with the keywords `"rainbow"` and `"BW"` to get different types of color changing.
